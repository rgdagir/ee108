## Lab files for EE108 - Digital Systems Design, class taken in Winter/2019. 
Disclaimer: It's important to note that some of the files here have not been written by me. I'd like to acknowledge Prof. Subhasish Mitra, Rahul Prabala, and the whole TA team (Eldrick Millares, Albert Mitchell Pleus, Alex Mallery) for the starter code on every assignment. I also have to acknowledge and thank my team, Kylee Krzanich and Sam Xu for the collaboration in implementing these projects.

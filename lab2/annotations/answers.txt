b. Nothing special.
c. Our testing strategy consisted of trying all edge cases we could think of,
in addition to some random normal cases, to validate and ensure the standard

d. We shift the number with smaller exponent right and add one to its exponent to make sure
that we won't lose precision on the biggest number wile adding them up, as well as certifying
that the smaller number won't be too small to the point where it won't affect the final result.
